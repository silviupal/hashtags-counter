# Hastags Manager
App for managing hashtags. Dedicated to Instagram lovers.

### Starting point - Version 1.0

All started from the moment I wanted to count my hashtags for a post on Instagram. 

On Android, at some point, if you added a description with more than 30 hashtags and then pressed Publish, Instagram would have removed the whole description.

So I created an app to check my description before publish it on Instagram, without counting manually the hashtags. That was version 1 called Hashtags Counter.

### Hashtags Counter becomes Hashtags Manager - Version 2.0

After receiving feedback from my friends, I added many functionalities based on their reply:

- save descriptions as templates for future posts
- save your favorite hashtags in order to be inserted into descriptions
- fast options to copy, paste, cut or delete a description.

### Technical

Developed in Kotlin, using Room to save data locally.

In progress: Separation of concernes - Clean Architecture.
